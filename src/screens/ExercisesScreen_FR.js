Begin with static pressure in one area of the trap. The traps are different than the long muscles within the legs. When rolling the hamstrings athletes will find trigger points throughout the length of the muscle. With the shorter trap muscle athletes will struggle to find one point on which to focus. This is why constant pressure in one area will begin loosening the muscle.",

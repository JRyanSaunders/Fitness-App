          restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you
          notice when we make a material change to the Services that would
          adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we

          Flex may offer the opportunity to purchase access to the Service by
          means of one-time or recurring payments (“Subscription”) through an
          authorized Marketplace Provider. These payments require you to have an
          active account with a Marketplace Provider and provide a then-current
          and valid method of payment, such as a credit card or debit card (a
          "Payment Method"). Payments will be processed by your respective
          Marketplace Provider and not through Flex. Any inquiries related to
          payments should be directed to your Marketplace Provider. You are

          Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including
          your breach of these Terms. Company has the sole right to decide
          whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in
          these Terms. Account termination may result in destruction of any
          Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you
          decide to terminate your account. Provisions that, by their nature,
          should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.

          obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our
          liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property
          rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

          intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,
          trade secrets, copyrights and patents); or (2) violations of
          provisions 13 or 14 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"),
          you agree that all disputes between you and Flex (whether or not such
          dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with
          Flex, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of
          Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or
          publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under
          the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of
          consumer-related disputes and you and Flex hereby expressly waive
          trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your
          local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's
          rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor
          Flex will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for
          any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to
          participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or
          representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another
          person's account, if Flex is a party to the proceeding. This dispute
          resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
          In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or
          unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days
          of filing the case, then either Flex or you can elect to have the
          arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and
          Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
          may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any
          provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not
          have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with
          these Terms of Use. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If
          you do so, neither you nor Flex can require the other to participate
          in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Flex in
          writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to
          this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:
          Bowery Digital LLC. ATTN: 1487 Dunwoody Drive, Suite One, West
          Chester, PA 19380 You must include your name and residence address,
          the email address you use for your Flex account, and a clear statement
          that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If the
          prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf
          of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then
          all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null
          and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of
          your relationship with Flex.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          ​These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with
          the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to any
          principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED
          BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
          SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in
          equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use,
          the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate,
          you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Flex exclusively in a
          state or federal court located in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and to
          submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Chester
          County, Pennsylvania for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.
          If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void,
          or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable
          from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and
          enforceability of any remaining provisions. Flex's failure to insist
          upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms
          will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver
          of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
          such term or condition or any other term or condition. Flex reserves
          the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such
          changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date
          of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the
          termination of any or all of your transactions with Flex. Entire
          Agreement ​ If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity,
          you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on
          behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire
          agreement between you and Flex and governs your use of the Service,
          superseding any prior agreements between you and Flex. You will not
          assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any
          obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by
          operation of law, without the prior written consent of Flex. Any
          purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate
          prior written consent of Flex will be null and void. Flex may assign
          these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If
          any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent
          jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties
          nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from
          these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability
          of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms
          of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct
          between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of
          Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary
          rights. Territorial Restrictions ​ The information provided within the
          Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
          entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use
          would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Flex to
          any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We
          reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any
          portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or
          jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the
          quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature
          that Flex provides. Software related to or made available by the
          Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no
          software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported:
          (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the
          United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S.
          Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the
          U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any
          software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you
          are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident
          of, any such country or on any such list. The effective date of these
          Terms of Use is May 1, 2020. These Terms of Use were written in
          English (US). To the extent any translated version of these Terms of
          Use conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.
